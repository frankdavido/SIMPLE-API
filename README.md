# SIMPLE-API
A simple API with Core PHP to perform CRUD operations


## Some Securities Put In Place
HTACCESS file
The /.htaccess file has securities in place to
* Enforce HTTPS on all request (re writing all http to https)
* Redirect all requests coming into not-existing directories and non-existing files to root invalid.php
* Black list offending IPs. 
Note: I can make PHP to automatically update this htaccess' line number 16 to automatically blacklist any offeding User's IP if he fails certain criteria.

## ‚≠ê Installation
- Move all the files except the License and Readme files into your website document root directory
- Open /api/settings.php file and change the credentials and settings accordingly. Found in /api/settings.php
- If you wish to improve performance of database: Open the /api/settings.php file and change the PERSISTENT_DATABASE_CONNECTION to true. For more performance use persistence connection to database (which reduces the connection overhead)
- Initialize the installation. See below

## Initialization
Before using the api, you must manually create all the required database and tables by any other means
	OR
You must use allow our script to automagically create required database and Table for you by visiting  http://youSiteAddress.com/api/init  from your browser.
