# SIMPLE-API

A simple API with Core PHP to perform CRUD operations
## Some Securities Put In Place

`HTACCESS file`
The /.htaccess file has securities in place to
* Enforce HTTPS on all request (re writing all http to https)
* Redirect all requests coming into not-existing directories and non-existing files to root invalid.php
* Black list offending IPs. 
Note: I can make PHP to automatically update this htaccess' line number 16 to automatically blacklist any offeding User's IP if he fails certain criteria.
`db/dbconn.php file`
* Use of PDO prepared statement to avoid SQL injection (SQL attack is a technique to hack sites database from any input form of apis. To read more on SQL attacks, for a start, see: )

## ‚≠ê Installation

- Move all the files except the License and Readme files into your website document root directory
- Open /api/settings.php file and change the credentials and settings accordingly. Found in /api/settings.php
- If you wish to improve performance of database: Open the /api/settings.php file and change the PERSISTENT_DATABASE_CONNECTION to true. This uses persistence connection to database (which reduces the connection overhead)
- Initialize the installation. See below

## Initialization

Before using the api, you must manually create all the required database and tables by any other means - CLI, Bash, PhpMyadmin, etc.

OR

You must use allow our script to automagically create required database and Table for you by visiting  //youSiteAddress.com/api/init  from your browser.
